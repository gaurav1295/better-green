The Nagami Kumquats, usually tart and highest in acidity, have mellowed a bit with late-season sweetness, adding more balance to their flavor profile.<\/p><p>Since 1989, Leticia's family have committed to growing diverse varieties to preserve unique flavors and ecosystem biodiversity. From 10 acres of barren land, the Garcia family has nurtured 29 acres of diverse orchards over time. The third generation is committed to practices to help the land flourish for future stewards. For a unique approach to pest control, they use lacewings, carnivorous snails, and ladybugs. Chicken compost, bio flora, cover crops, and mulch are used to maintain and improve the soil.<\/p>",
